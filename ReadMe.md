## About Me

I'm a Computer and Software Engineering student from Serbia, currently focused on building my portfolio and growing as a backend developer.

I'm passionate about software architecture, clean code, and scalable system design. I enjoy working with technologies like Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and RESTful APIs. I'm also comfortable with Git for version control, and I constantly aim to improve my understanding of algorithms and system design patterns.

Beyond tech, I’m a person with wide interests, always open to meeting new people and building meaningful connections — both in tech and beyond.
